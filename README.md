# My first backend project with Node.js

Following Ania Kubow's tutorial [part 1](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3lqUHeZs_0) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wXYg8Eslnc) I learned how to scrape data from a website and display the data from the backend to the frontend.
I have adapted the project to suit my needs: getting data from a different website, grabbing the html of a relevant class for my project, making the links clickable and arranging them in an ordered list, adding more style to how the data is displayed in the browser, etc.
The tutorial project's repo can be found [here](https://github.com/kubowania/nodejs-webscraper)


**For this project I've used:**

- Node.js version 18.12.1
- Axios version 1.2.0
- Cheerio version 1.0.0-rc.12
- Cors 2.8.5
- Express 4.18.2 
- Nodemon version 2.0.20

**Work in progress**
